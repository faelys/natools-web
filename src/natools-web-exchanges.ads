-- Natools.Web.Exchanges provides a type representing a single immutable    --
-- HTTP request and the associated response being bulit.                    --
-- It is mostly meant as an abstraction of the HTTP backend. The            --
-- implementation here sits on top of AWS, though a similar interface       --
-- should be easy to built for other HTTP backends.                         --
